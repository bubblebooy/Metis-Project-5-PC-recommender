## Data

Data was scrapped from PcPartPicker.com using [Data Scraping](Data%20Scraping.ipynb) and then pickeled. Do not try to re-scrape the data, required entereing a captcha ever 25-50 request and your ip will eventually be blocked.

## Analysis

The data was combined cleaned and analyzed in [PcPartPicker analysis](PcPartPicker%20analysis.ipynb)

I looked into doing network anylisis with the data in [Network - PcPartPicker](Network%20-%20PcPartPicker.ipynb) and Gephi but did not end up using it.
